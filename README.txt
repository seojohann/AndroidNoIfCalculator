No “If” Calculator

First Goal  Create a four function calculator (add, subtract, multiply, divide) without using any “If” or “Switch” statements.
IE, let user enter “2 + 3”, click “enter”, and display “5”

Second Goal:  Support full algebraic expressions that respect operator precedence. IE, let the user enter “2 + 5 * 3” and compute the answer “17”,
because multiplication is evaluated first before addition.

Time:  Please don’t spend more than 8 hours on this challenge.  If after 8 hours you don’t have both goals finished, that’s fine, just send us what
you have.  (If it takes less than 8 hours, great.)

You will not be judged on the User Interface.  Treat this is as a 100% OOP design problem.  In other words, don’t worry about making it look pretty.
We’ve provided a simple start project that contains the UI of the calculator.  Feel free to modify it if you need to – we’re just trying to provide
a head start so that you can focus on the actual task at hand: designing a computation solution.
